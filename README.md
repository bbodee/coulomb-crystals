# coulomb-crystals
this is me trying to recreate an old project from senior year at Lawrence University, where I tried simulating the creation of "Coulomb Crystals"

The plan is to break this out easy.

The first mini project is 1 particle in 1 dimension.  MD1D is molecular dynamics 1 dimension.

Next step is adding 2 particles and have them start interacting with their potentials.

Then generalizing to N particles.

The next project is to expand it to 2 dimensional space.
  I want to have ths to eventually using 2 different potentals

The next project after that s 3 dimensional space

Finally I want to generalize the code.
